Project: Business Card Design
Hey there! This is a business card I designed for a fashion designer named "Genesis & Gravitas". I wanted it to look really classy and professional, just like a high-end fashion brand.


Objective:
My main goal was to create a clean, elegant business card that a fashion designer could use to represent their brand, Genesis & Gravitas.



Steps I Took:

The Look: I decided on a classic and high-end feel, using a simple color palette.


The Logo: The main part of the design is a big, bold "GG" logo  that stands out.



The Layout: I put the logo on the front and all the important contact information on the back. This keeps the design clean and focused.

Tools Used:
I used a graphic design program to put everything together.

Outcome:
I think the card turned out great! It has a very elegant feel, and the design is simple but professional. All the key details like the name, phone number , email , and address  are easy to see
